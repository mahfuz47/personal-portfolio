                    I am a beginner level web developer and I am not too much well in it but I can build a normal website by HTML and CSS. In that case I try to learn from various ways like different types of website. The most user friendly web sites for me are Programming hero and W3schools. Though it's enough tough for long term practice but I know that I can do it.

                    One of my favorite skill is cinematography. And that's why I learned video editing but I think editing doesn't matter. Only content is the real asset of my skill. When I was in class 7, that time I have made an 8 min short film which name was "The Terrorist Attack"!!! After that, I made a different type of short film where I tried to show the reflection of our country system and this short film's name was <a class="l1" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGahfqevzsM&t=30s"> "Knight"</a>
